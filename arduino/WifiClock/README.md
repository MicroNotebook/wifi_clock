# WifiClock
WifiClock is an Arduino library written for the Wifi Clock kit developed by MicroNote. This board is centered around a NodeMCU board and should not be used with any other microcontroller.

## Documentation
Documentation for the Wifi Clock kit is on our website [here](https://micronote.tech/wificlock_product/index.html). Documentation for the library can be found on our [github page](https://github.com/MicroNotebook/wifi_clock/tree/master/arduino).

## Download
The latest source code version of the Library is always available from the 
[WifiClock page](https://github.com/MicroNotebook/wifi_clock/tree/master/arduino).

## Installation
The library can be installed using the [standard Arduino library install procedure](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#.UwxndHX5PtY).

## Dependencies
This library needs the *NTPClient* and *LedControl* libraries installed to function correctly. These libraries can be installed with the **Library Manager** in Arduino (see [standard Arduino library install procedure](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#.UwxndHX5PtY)).
